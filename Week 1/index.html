        <h2>Brief bio:</h2>
        <p>
            I was born and grew up in Liberia, West Africa, and I also earned my primary education there. Upon
            graduation, I moved to Accra, Ghana, a country also in West Africa for higher education. That is where
            I acquired my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I'm now in the US studying MS Software
            Engineering, and I aspire to be a full-stack developer soon. During my free time, I play video games and
            soccer.
