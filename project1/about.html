            I am a Liberian native from West Africa. I grew up in the city-center, Monrovia, in a middle-class
            neighborhood called New Matadi Estate. Like every other regular kid, my childhood was a fun one. I had
            siblings and friends around to play with and we made a lot of good memories together.
        </p>

            Growing up, I always had a passion for art but didn't how I was going to turn that passion into a career. In
            high school, I did Arts, Science, and Business related subjects because my school didn't allow majoring. I
            was exposed to a lot of information with less depth into any of them. It was difficult for me to figure out
            what I wanted to do because I was pretty good at all of those subjects. I was in a state of a dilemma until
            2016 when I graduated.
        </p>

        <p>
            After I graduated high school, I had a sudden love for coding but again, I didn't know what to do within the
            Technology space because everything was new to me. I didn't have any foundational level education but I
            still chose to go ahead and do something that was Technology-related for my undergrad. I did my research and
            decided to pursue a Bachelor's in Information Technology. I did my undergrad at Bluecrest University
            College, Ghana, West Africa. The experience was a good one but the structure of the program was similar to
            that of my high school curriculum. From the first to the last semester, we were assigned courses
            automatically. We didn't have the choice of selecting electives. The school chose electives in Procurement,
            Accounting, Management, and Entrepreneurship. Again, a lot of information with no depth. I graduated college
            with a Summa Cum Laude but still didn't know what my career path was.
        </p>

        <p>
            Upon graduation, I decided to take courses on Coursera, EdX, and attend a Full-stack Web Development
            Bootcamp whilst I awaited RIT admission confirmation. It was during that time I believe that I found myself
            and figured out what I want to do for the next 10-15 years. To this day, I still have that burning desire of
            channelling my ideas and innovation through graphics, web design, and development.
