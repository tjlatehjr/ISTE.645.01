                        Sergey Brin was born on August 21, 1973, in Moscow, Russia. He came from a well-off family with
                        both
                        parents having college degrees and jobs. He and his parents (Micheal and Engenia Brin) moved to
                        the US
                        in 1979 when he was about six (6) years old because of the discrimination his dad faced being a
                        Jew. His
                        family settled in Maryland, where his dad took a job at the University of Maryland teaching
                        math.

                    <p>
                        Growing up, Sergey had excellent skills in math and science because of his background. He
                        breezed
                        through middle school easily and spent three (3) years in high school and college respectively.
                        Sergey
                        was awarded a National Science Foundation scholarship that enabled him to apply and get admitted
                        to
                        Stanford University, where he met Larry Page as a second-year student.

                    <p>
                        Sergey and Larry, along with four other graduate students, spent a vast majority of their time
                        in
                        Larry’s office (room 360) at the newly created computer center that was named after Bill Gates.
                        They
                        created a home away from home with hanging plants, a sleeping pad, and a piano that connected to
                        a
                        computer. (Sergey Brin and Larry Page: Founders of Google - Stephanie Sammartino McPherson -

                        The duo began Google as a research project with a third founder, Scott Hassan who wrote the code
                        for the
                        search engine but later went on to do robotics. The search engine (BackRub) was based on an
                        algorithm
                        called PageRank that worked better than the Status quo at the time. It ranked websites based on
                        how many
                        pages they had and how relevant the pages that linked back to the original site were. The work
                        of Robin
                        Li, the creator of RankDex, was mentioned in the PageRank patent as having influenced the
                        creation of
                        PageRank. The duo collaborated on their first paper on the idea with Rajeev Motwani and Terry
                        Winograd,
                        and Hassan and Steremberg are also credited with being critical to the development of Google.

                        The search engine was later changed from BackRub to Google. On September 15, 1997, the domain
                        name
                        "www.google.com" was registered, and the corporation was formed on September 4, 1998. They were
                        able to
                        acquire around $1,000,000 from friends and family, as well as an investment from an Angel
                        Investor, and
                        opened their first shop in Menlo Park, California.

                        Steve Jobs founded Apple alongside Steve Wozniak in 1976. Jobs had the vision to bring computing
                        to the
                        mass market through beautiful and accessible design, branding Apple’s computers as “the computer
                        for the
                        rest of us”. The Macintosh computer is responsible for bringing us the mouse and keyboard as
                        well as the
                        window based graphical interface that we use today. It is this window interface that allowed Tim
                        Berners-Lee to create a widely accessible hypertext internet that we know as the world wide web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon resuming work as the permanent CEO of Apple in 2000, Jobs began to shift the intent of the
                        company
                        back to his vision. He took inspiration from Mies van der Rohe’s “Less is more” approach to
                        design. As
                        such, Steve Jobs began to insist that product design must drive the engineering at Apple rather
                        than the
                        other way around stating “We’re the only company that owns the whole widget—the hardware, the
                        software,
                        and the operating system. We can take full responsibility for the user experience. We can do
                        things that
                        the other guys can’t do”. It is this user-first philosophy that helped to propel the design
                        space within
                        tech.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jobs’ next leap in innovation with regards to the web came in 2007. The iPhone hit the market
                        and
                        instantly changed the way we interact with the web. With practical touch screens, mobile phones
                        soon
                        became the primary environment for many’s web experiences.

                        The success of Apple can be attributed to Steve Jobs’ commitment to not just the functionality
                        of its
                        products, but also the aesthetics. Jobs aimed to deliver products that delighted its customers.
                        As a
                        result, he was able to help move the web and computing from a professional tool to an everyday
                        necessity.

                        The inventor of the web as we know it today. Berners-Lee began to develop his idea for the world
                        wide
                        web
                        in 1989. He had been working for CERN for five years and wanted to implement a hypertext based
                        system
                        for CERN’s massive internal network of data and documentation. At the time hypertext was a niche
                        software method that was primarily restricted to closed systems. What Tim Berners-Lee
                        envisioned,
                        however, was a unified hypertext standard and protocols that could be accessible to anyone
                        connected on
                        the internet.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Through his work in creating the world wide web, Berners-Lee needed to instate unifying
                        standards that
                        would ensure compatibility regardless of operating systems or hardware. As a result he created
                        three
                        internet standards that persist hrough today. These standards are HyperText Markup Language
                        (HTML),
                        HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and Uniform Resource Locator (URL).

                        Upon seeing his proposed platform, CERN allocated time for Berners-Lee to begin coding the world
                        wide
                        web. Tim along with a team mostly of interns was able to cleverly combine and adapt established
                        toolsets in order to develop and release a world wide web prototype software package on the
                        internet
                        within ten months time.
