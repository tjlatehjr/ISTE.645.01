        <h2>The City</h2>

        <p>
            Rochester is a city in the U.S. state of New York, the seat of Monroe County,
            and the third-most populous in the state after New York City and Buffalo
            with a population of 211,328 in 2020. The city of Rochester forms the
            core of a larger metropolitan area with a population of 1 million people,
            across six counties, which in turn is part of the larger Western New York
            region that has a population of roughly two million. <span>The city was one of
                the United States' first boomtowns</span>, initially due to the fertile Genesee
            River Valley, which gave rise to numerous flour mills, and then as a manufacturing
            center, which spurred further rapid population growth.

        <p>
            Native Americans came to the area now called New York about 5,000 years ago.
            Thousands of years later, their descendants included Native American tribes
            such as the Mohawk, Cayuga, Oneida, and Seneca. In 1624 the Dutch established
            a colony on what’s now Manhattan Island called New Amsterdam. It was renamed
            New York once the British took control of the area in 1664. But after the
            American Revolution in 1776, New York became a U.S. colony, then a state in 1788.
            One year later, George Washington was sworn in as the United States’ first
            president in New York City, then the country’s capital. (It would move to
            Washington, D.C., the next year, in 1790.)

        <h2>A Great Place to Live</h2>


        <p>
            A unique blend of natural and man-made resources and amenities give Rochester
            a quality of life that is second to none. Straddling the Genesee River between
            the Erie Canal and Lake Ontario, Rochester offers a natural beauty that is easily
            accessible by a network of parks, trails, boat launches and scenic overlooks.
            The city is divided into dozens of distinct neighborhoods and urban villages
            supported by an eclectic mix of stores and restaurants. Quality housing available
            at reasonable prices, well-paying jobs and a transportation system that minimizes
            traffic congestion combine with a wide variety of cultural institutions and
            entertainment options to make Rochester an easy place to enjoy a comfortable
            work-life balance. The city’s central location in Western New York provides
            residents a short drive to such destinations as the Niagara Falls, the Finger
            Lakes region and the Adirondack Mountains. Big cities, including New York,
            Toronto and Boston are also within a day’s drive.

        <h2>A Great Place to Work</h2>
        <p>
            Rochester’s economy benefits from many advantages, including an ample
            supply of fresh water from Lake Ontario and the pristine Finger Lakes,
            a central location among the population centers of the Northeastern
            United States and the innovative foundations laid by such firms as Kodak,
            Xerox and Bausch and Lomb. A host of colleges and universities,
            including the University of Rochester and the Rochester Institute of
            Technology, produce an educated workforce and generates cutting-edge
            research that drives the city’s innovation and technology sectors.
            Rochester is emerging as the imaging, optics and photonics capital of the
            world and in 2015 the White House announced that new Integrated Photonics
            Institute for Manufacturing Innovation would be located in Rochester. Other growing
            industries include food-and-beverage manufacturing, biotechnology and green innovation.
